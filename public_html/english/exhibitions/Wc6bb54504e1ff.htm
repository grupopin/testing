	<p>The first time I came in contact with Japanese woodcut-prints was in  Italy when I was hitchhiking with friends and I saw rainfalls of  Hiroshige as some peasants walked with umbrellas in the rain, and I saw  Hokusai prints with the Fujiyama in the background and with clouds and  with water and waves, and this all left such a deep impression on me  that I decided later to do prints.</p>
	<p>Immediately I did some sketches for woodcut-prints - it was all in  1950. It took a very long time, ten years later, finally, when I was  myself in Tokyo I could contact the first Japanese woodcutters and it  was very difficult to convince them to work together with an European  artist, because they are very jealous of their art and it is right so.  (from: <i>Japanese woodcut-prints and I</i>, 1977)</p>

	<p>This was the beginning of a long period of working together with my  friend, the &quot;Coordinatore&quot; Alberto Della Vecchia. Up to that time I had  resisted doing graphics. What had been done in this line hitherto had  come about more or less because I had no choice. Until Alberto brought  me a &quot;Hundertwasser graphic&quot; he had done. I immediately felt ill: this  was kitsch which aped my style. Nonetheless, it was the decisive  impetus to do it better, to do it right. Thus &quot;King Kong&quot; came to be. <i>Hundertwasser</i></p>

	<p>This is my first large print edition, which I numbered from beginning  to end; but actually it isn't one, since it consists of many  variations. It is based on 151 <em>Bleeding Houses</em>. I spent  months in the print shop in Campalto, while the Regentag lay in berth  not far away, in a canal of the lagoon near Ca' Noghera. It was like a  simultaneous chess match with more than forty opponents. I did this  even more radically later with the silkscreen print 860 <em>Homo Humus come va</em>.  I don't think anyone can outdo me in this gigantic enterprise, which  took up two years of my life. I used completely new techniques in print  graphics: metallic-stamp printing, phosphorescent colours that glow in  the dark, reflecting glass-bead appliqu&eacute;s, convex embossing and an  incredible number of colour overprints which I painted separately on  transparent foil, from where they were transferred to the screen. Then  the proofs of the infinite number of colour combinations. I wanted to  reduce the conveyor belt to absurdity. I got myself into a bind between  the incredible demand which had materialised and my pride in creating  something original, not mass-produced, and I wanted to give as much of  my inner self as I could. I went to court and won because I wanted to  keep the prices low (just like with the Art Club portfolio of 1951) -  100 marks per print, to make it accessible to many people. It was all  for nought. I could not fix the price on the open market. It was a  victory and a defeat all in one.<br><i>Hundertwasser</i></p>

	<p>My division of labour for print-graphics production was in full force:  Japan for wood-block prints, Paris for lithography, Venice for  silkscreen printing and Vienna for engraving and copperplate engraving.  I think there is no better way of dividing up and utilising the  traditional mastery in the various sectors of print graphics.<br><i>Hundertwasser</i></p>

	</dl>
	<p>&hellip;Now with my 83rd graphic work I succeeded in producing as many different specimens as their number in the edition. I succeeded not only in creating a graphic work, but a genuine original graphic work, a unique original. This actually was only a last step into the direction of a good conscience.</p>

    <p>The word <b>original graphic work</b> should mean that this graphic specimen is an original, a unique work, not a reproduction nor a duplication, i.e., </p>
    <ol>
	<li>it is not a reproduction after a picture,</li>
	<li>it does not exist a second time.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The only difference from a hand-painted picture is that it was produced  by a printing technique and not by using a paintbrush.  In the age of reproduction and duplication and mass production I am  proud of having been the first to transform and vanguish the assembly  line. When the machine produces originals it will lose its terror and  cease to be an assembly line.  <i>(from: On Original Graphic, 1984)</i></p>
