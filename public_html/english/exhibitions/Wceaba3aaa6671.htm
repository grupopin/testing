		<dd>Tapestrie,</dd>
		<dd>1952</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>The tapestry which I did in Vienna in 1952 would not exist if it was  not for a bet.  The two weavers Riedl and Schidlo insisted, a tapestry can only be  woven after a cartoon the size of the tapestry itself. My opinion was  that it could be done without and as I did not give in, they lent me a  loom. I dragged it home myself, I believe it was on a push-cart, and  the two weavers helped me to erect the loom and lent me coloured wool  in many tints and then I started weaving.<br />
I was amazed to see how endless it got; it grew a few millimeters per  day only. I always had to push the wool back into the warp with the  comb-hammer and thus 5 cms became one or two millimeters. I slowly  worked my tapestry upwards and it took me six months during which I  worked from eight in the morning till eight at night with hands and  feet - never in my life have I laboured so intensely and for so long a  time.<br />
I began with the toes, they became a trouserleg and to the right of it  appeared a house.  </p>
	<p>As I wove I kept thinking what could fill the background and what I  could conceive for higher-up. </p>
	<p>As I had started on with a trouser-leg, a  body had to follow, arms, and a head; there were to be windows in the  background, and if one makes windows, there must be a roof to top them  off, and this is how I finished the tapestry and won my bet.
