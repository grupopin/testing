		<dt>97 THE MIRCULOUS DRAUGHT</dt>
		<dd>In collaboration with Ren&eacute; Br&ocirc;</dd>
		<dd>Mixed media</dd>
		<dd>St. Mand&eacute;, 1950</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>In that time, I made a deal with Br&ocirc;. Br&ocirc; painted almond-shaped eyes  high up in the face with nose, rivers and ship-mouth in circular-shaped  heads. I painted soul-trees that means trees which had a halo of glory  like human beings and saints. Trees where you could see through as if  they were made out of spheres of glass. These trees I had seen in the  drawings of Walter Kampmann. Br&ocirc; gave me the right to paint his faces,  and I gave Br&ocirc;</p>
	<p> the right to paint my &quot;soul-trees&quot;.<br/>

		<dt>227  A RAINDROP WHICH FALLS INTO THE CITY</dt>
		<dd>Watercolour</dd>
		<dd>Paris, 1955</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<p>This watercolour is also one I folded in four parts and only painted one quarter at a time. It is like a continuation of the thought of pictures 153 and 154 <em>Automobile with Red Raindrops</em>, only now the raindrop is falling on a city - an appeal to a new urbanism in harmony with creation. The tachistically falling drop is meticulously depicted, or as I said later, Each raindrop is a kiss from heaven.<br/><i>Hundertwasser</i>

		<dt>460 HOMMAGE AU TACHISME</dt>
		<dd>Mixed media</dd>
		<dd>La Picaudi&egrave;re, 1961</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>To me the most honest form of Tachism was total self-renunciation: if a  painter climbs up a ladder with a bucket of paint and shoots himself up  there, letting the paint fall &quot;automatically&quot; onto the canvas waiting  on the floor, that is the most sublime act of Tachistic  self-renunciation. The canvas is like a jumping sheet, the paint sticks  to it, the dead initiator falls through it. Painting blind- blindfolded  - or drawing left-handed - when you're right-handed - are not so  totally honest, and when you let snails, monkeys, donkey tails,  elephant trunks do the painting, it is somebody else doing the work,  albeit Tachistically correctly. With this picture I wanted to show very  lucidly and immediately and precisely how a Tachistically  fluidoid-spiraloid painting done in a state of complete awareness looks  as if it were from a different viewpoint, a different time and world,  when it is painted with the traditional method. I had great respect for  Tachism, but as an outsider.<br/><i>Hundertwasser</i></p>

		<dt>583 TWO ENVELOPES ON A LONG VOYAGE</dt>
		<dd>Watercolour</dd>
		<dd>Hamburg, 1964</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>As so many times before, for example 188 <em>The Parliamentary Content of an Arrow</em>, 180 <em>Steamer and Maelstrom in a Garden</em>, 201 <em>Shirt-sleeve Pattern</em>, 581 <em>The Impotent Krka Waterfalls</em>,  the irregular form of the edges of the painted surface is very  significant, as it itself becomes an essential part of the picture.  Unfolded letter envelopes, tailor's patterns can be used for nothing.  You don't have to do anything in addition, otherwise the ready-made  form is bad and implausible, and the contrast between the painted and  the external form is ruined. The margin is like the skin. When I start  painting, I don't know where to begin: from the edge towards the centre  or from the centre towards the edge. - Let things take their own course.<br/>

		<dt>622 MOURNING SCHIELE</dt>
		<dd>Mixed media</dd>
		<dd>Lugano, 1965</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>I love Schiele, Picasso and Klee and their ilk, and Giotto, the old  masters and the like. But in-between and besides them there is a  yawning emptiness. The simple is still broad.</p>
	<p>I often dream like Schiele, my father, about flowers that are red,  and birds and flying fish and gardens in velvet and emerald green and  human beings who walk, weeping, in red-yellow and ocean-blue.  (from: I love Schiele, 1950/1951)</p>

	</dl>
	<p>A Hundertwasser House architecture reverie. The project was in  progress. Combining architecture and painting is difficult. I am  reproached in architecture circles for just painting houses: it is all  a Potemkin fa&ccedil;ade, i. e., flat, with nothing behind it. And at that I  build in tandem with the architect Pelikan extremely varied,  complicated houses full of nooks and crannies. It is on the contrary  precisely the T-square-straight, soulless architectures which are flat  and easy to analyse and construct with a computer. My houses - the  computer people have said - often need more data input than medieval  cathedrals.<br/><i>Hundertwasser</i></p>

		<dt>959 BURNING FACE</dt>
		<dd>Mixed media</dd>
		<dd>Wien, 1998</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>The picture is important to me because it is the only one done on a  white ground - on canvas - which my mother prepared herself. She wanted  to paint on it, but then she died. Then the prepared canvas was kicking  around my place for years. After my mother tried at all costs to talk  me out of taking up painting as my profession: that was a &quot;starveling's  trade&quot;, she later, at about age seventy, took up painting herself, I  think to prove to me that she could paint, too, in the naive style of  Grandma Moses, who, at a very advanced age, after a full life, began to  paint in her retirement and became a sensation in the art world.  Grandma Moses painted until she was over a hundred years old; my mother  died at 87.<br/><i>Hundertwasser</i></p>
