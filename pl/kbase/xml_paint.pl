paint_hundertwasser_comment(142,'Durch die Menschgr&Atilde;&para;&Atilde;e dieser Spirale wirkt sie wie eine Art Menschenfalle. Ich begann genau in der Mitte und trieb jeden Tag die Spirale ein St&Atilde;&frac14;ck weiter nach au&Atilde;en. Durch die Komplement&Atilde;&curren;rfarben rot-blau wird ein starkes Vibrieren erzielt in den Farben. In den Spiralzwischenr&Atilde;&curren;umen sind kleine Fl&Atilde;&curren;chen eingemalt, die sich erg&Atilde;&curren;nzend ein Kreuz innerhalb der Spirale bilden. Ich habe auch an das Kreish&Atilde;&frac14;pfspiel der Kinder gedacht, das Schneckenh&Atilde;&frac14;pfspiel (jeu d&#039;oie sagt man in Frankreich). Man beginnt zu h&Atilde;&frac14;pfen und n&Atilde;&curren;hert sich immer mehr dem Zentrum, bis man daneben tritt und wieder von vorne anfangen mu&Atilde;. Man geht vor und man mu&Atilde; sich zur&Atilde;&frac14;ckziehen, wie es im Leben auch ist. Diese Bild ist um eine Betrachtungsart reicher als die anderen. Man braucht es n&Atilde;&curren;mlich nicht als Ganzes sehen, sondern man kann vom Zentrum aus dem ganzen Weg der Spirale mit den Fingern oder mit den Augen folgen und sich dessen bewu&Atilde;t werden, wie schmal der Weg oft wird, wie er in den Farben wechselt und welche Hindernisse es alle auf dem Wege gibt. Um dem Weg rein mechanisch zu folgen, ist allein schon eine Zeit von einigen Minuten notwendig. Man kommt u. a. auch auf Ausbuchtungen, die wie Seen oder Lichtungen anmuten. Das Ganze &Atilde;&curren;hnelt auch einer riesigen zusammengerollten Viper, die gerade dabei ist, einige Lebewesen zu verdauen, die sie gerade geschluckt hat. Auch ist das Bild dazu angetan, im Beschauer eine Art Schwindelgef&Atilde;&frac14;hl hervorzurufen. Als Ganzes gesehen wird das Bild von einiger Entfernung aus zu einem langen perspektivischen Schlauch von innen gesehen, der in den blauen Himmel m&Atilde;&frac14;ndet.  (Hundertwasser, 1955)').
paint_hundertwasser_comment(142,'Because of the human scale of this spiral, it seems like a human trap of sorts. I started out exactly in the middle, pushing the spiral a bit further outward each day. The complementary colors red and blue make for a powerfully vibrating tonality. The open spaces within the spiral have been filled in with small fields that add up to form a cross within the spiral. I also had in mind the circular form of hopscotch that kids play and that&#039;s called &quot;Snail&#039;s Hopscotch&quot; in German (the French call it jeu d&#039;oie). You start hopping and gradually move toward the center, until you miss a field and have to start all over again. You advance and are forced to retreat, just like in real life. Compared to the other images, this one allows for an additional way of viewing, as you do not have to look at it as a whole. Starting in the middle you can follow the entire course of the spiral with your finger or your eyes and become aware of how narrow the path often gets, how its colors change and what obstacles there are on the way. In order to follow the course mechanically you need to allow yourself several minutes at least. Among other things, you will arrive at bulges that seem like lakes or clearings. At the same time, the whole thing resembles a giant coiled-up snake that is digesting a few living beings it has just swallowed. The image is also likely to induce a feeling of dizziness in the viewer. When viewed from a distance, the image as a whole becomes the inside of a long hose seen in perspective, that leads into the blue sky.  (Hundertwasser, 1955)').

paint_hundertwasser_comment_en(13,'Tr&Atilde;&curren;nen und Regentropfen wurden zu analogen Begriffen, die mich immer wieder ob ihrer &Atilde;&curren;hnlichen Funktion in den Bann zogen. Sie wurden sozusagen Teil meines &quot;Repertoires&quot; wie die Spirale, die Fenster, Bullaugen, Z&Atilde;&curren;une, Mandelaugen, &quot;Alien Heads&quot;, Dampfer, Sedimentstreifen, Kampmann-B&Atilde;&curren;ume, Schachtelh&Atilde;&curren;user, Zellen mit Zellkern, Schlu&Atilde;steine, Rauch und vieles mehr.    Waldviertel, Dreik&Atilde;&para;nigstag 1970  Liebe Maria Bilger, Ich hatte gehofft, da&Atilde; Du feinf&Atilde;&frac14;hlig genug bist und da&Atilde; ich es nicht zu sagen brauchte. Aber da Du weiterdr&Atilde;&curren;ngst, mu&Atilde; ich Dir schreiben, da&Atilde; Du mein Aquarell nicht bekommst, aus 2 Gr&Atilde;&frac14;nden. 1. Du hast das Aquarell &quot;OASE NACH DER ERZ&Atilde;HLUNG DES THAIB BEN THAMI&quot; Werk Nr. 115 bei der Ausstellung mit Schidlo-Riedl  Hundertwasser-Bilder ohne meine Zustimmung, ohne mein Wissen zerschnitten. Ich bekam nur das Mittelst&Atilde;&frac14;ck zur&Atilde;&frac14;ck, die abgeschnittenen Randteile jedoch bis jetzt nicht. Ich mu&Atilde; darauf dringen, da&Atilde; Du mir die abgeschnittenen Teile zur&Atilde;&frac14;ckerstattest, wobei es fraglich ist, ob ein Restaurator die zerschnittenen Teile wieder zusammenf&Atilde;&frac14;gen kann. Diese Zerschneidung ist also glaube ich nicht wieder gut zu machen. Ich verstehe nicht, wie Du als K&Atilde;&frac14;nstlerin mit Kunstwerken anderer so umgehen kannst.  2. Das Aquarell &quot;Weinender Mann mit Hut&quot; habe ich gerettet und w&Atilde;&curren;re ohne mein Dazutun verlorengegangen. Als ich nach diesem Bild fragte, um es fotografieren zu k&Atilde;&para;nnen, wu&Atilde;test Du gar nicht mehr, wo es war; in Deiner ehemalige Wohnung am Karlsplatz, die Du damals schon verlassen hattest, war nur noch Mist zum Wegwerfen. Alles, was Du f&Atilde;&frac14;r wert hieltest mitzunehmen, war weg. Was blieb, sollte der neue Mieter, der bereits im Einziehen war, wegwerfen. Es waren da St&Atilde;&para;&Atilde;e von Altpapier, Schachteln, Skizzen, alles zum Wegwerfen und dazwischen unter wertlosen Plakaten mein Bild. Mit dem Bild zur Wand, zum Zeichen, da&Atilde; Du die R&Atilde;&frac14;ckseite mehr sch&Atilde;&curren;tztest als den &quot;Weinenden Mann&quot;, mit Rei&Atilde;n&Atilde;&curren;geln und Scotchtape grauenhaft an der Wand befestigt, verblichen und mit Wasserflecken, das von der Decke rann, versehen. Oder diese Flecken waren (sind) so arg, da&Atilde; es vielleicht Kaffeeflecken oder sonstiges sind. Die Besch&Atilde;&curren;digungen sind also: 1. Fleckenstreifen &Atilde;&frac14;ber das ganze Bild und durch das ganze Papier durchgehend. 2. Besch&Atilde;&curren;digung durch Rei&Atilde;n&Atilde;&curren;gel und Scotch-Tape. 3. Verbleichen der ebenfalls bemalten R&Atilde;&frac14;ckseite durch wahrscheinlich Sonneneinwirkung (blaues Papier wurde braun). Ich brachte das Aquarell zum Restaurator CASPAR, der ein Jahr lang versuchte, das Bild zu retten. Er gab es mir zur&Atilde;&frac14;ck mit dem Vermerk, da&Atilde; die Sch&Atilde;&curren;den so gro&Atilde; sind, da&Atilde; es nicht restauriert werden kann! Du kannst verstehen, da&Atilde; ich jemandem, der ein Aquarell von mir derart zugrunde gehen l&Atilde;&curren;&Atilde;t und es au&Atilde;erdem noch zum Wegwerfen in den Koloniak&Atilde;&frac14;bel bestimmt hat, es nicht wieder anvertrauen kann. H&Atilde;&curren;tte ich nicht eingegriffen, w&Atilde;&curren;re es schon l&Atilde;&curren;ngst am Misthaufen. Auch hier kann ich nicht verstehen, wie Du als K&Atilde;&frac14;nstlerin mit den Werken anderer Kollegen so umgehen kannst. H&Atilde;&curren;ttest Du das Bild gekauft, w&Atilde;&curren;rest Du vielleicht sorgsam damit umgegangen. Warhscheinlich. Du wei&Atilde;t, wie sehr mir meine Bilder am Herzen liegen. Es ist hier meine K&Atilde;&frac14;nstlerehre mit F&Atilde;&frac14;&Atilde;en getreten worden. Jedenfalls. Eine Frau, die ein Kind mi&Atilde;handelt und es nachher wegwirft, hat ja auch jegliches Recht am Kind verloren, besonders, wenn es gar nicht ihr eigenes ist, sondern ein ihr anvertrautes. Wenn Du darauf bestehst, sende ich Dir die diversen Unterlagen: 1. Foto des zerschnittenen Bildes 2. Expertengutachten des Restaurators etc. Also diese unangenehme Sache w&Atilde;&curren;re hinter mir gebracht, und ich w&Atilde;&frac14;rde Dich gerne wiedersehen und auch sehen, was Du tust. Und Dir zeigen, was ich seither getan habe. Ich war bei Kumpf zu Besuch und bin jetzt im Waldviertel in der alten S&Atilde;&curren;ge meiner Mutter.

Wir machten unser Versprechen wahr, das wir uns im August 1949 in der Toskana gegeben hatten, n&Atilde;&curren;mlich gemeinsam ein &quot;Fresko&quot; wie Giotto zu malen.

paint_hundertwasser_comment_en(20,'&Atilde;u&Atilde;erst selten einmal arbeiten K&Atilde;&frac14;nstler in unserer egozentrischen, rational und funktional ausgerichteten Gesellschaft zusammen. Jeder K&Atilde;&frac14;nstler strebt egoistisch nach Einzigartigkeit. In der heutigen Zeit geschieht es nicht oft, dass sich zwei unabh&Atilde;&curren;ngige K&Atilde;&frac14;nstler zusammentun, um gemeinsam aus reinem Enthusiasmus ein Kunstwerk zu schaffen. Br&Atilde;&acute; und ich haben in Zusammenarbeit zwei gro&Atilde;e Wandbilder gemalt: 96 Land der Menschen, V&Atilde;&para;gel und Schiffe  und 97 Der wunderbare Fischfang. 96 Paradies - Land der Menschen, V&Atilde;&para;gel und Schiffe haben wir mit Kaseinfarbe direkt auf eine Wand gemalt. Unter dem Einfluss der gro&Atilde;en Wandgem&Atilde;&curren;lde in der Toskana (Giotto, Paolo Uccello) und im Palais des Papstes in Avignon wollten wir etwas gleichwertig Phantastisches und Bedeutendes schaffen.  Wir beschlossen, das zweite Wandgem&Atilde;&curren;lde - 97 Der wunderbare Fischfang - nicht direkt auf die Wand, sondern auf Platten zu malen, die entfernt werden k&Atilde;&para;nnten, falls der alte Jagdpavillon, in dem wir malten, abgerissen werden w&Atilde;&frac14;rde, was einige Jahre sp&Atilde;&curren;ter auch tats&Atilde;&curren;chlich geschah. Bei dem Haus handelte es sich um den ehemaligen Jagdpavillon Napoleons III. am Rande des Bois de Vincennes in Paris, wo Napoleon sich mit seiner Maitresse, der Comtesse de Castiglione, traf. Ich lebte und malte als Gast der Familie Dumage ungef&Atilde;&curren;hr zehn Jahre in diesem Pavillon. Als er in den 60er Jahren abgerissen wurde, zerlegte Prof. Licata das Wandgem&Atilde;&curren;lde in Teilst&Atilde;&frac14;cke; diese wurden dann in einem Container nach Amerika transportiert und dort in einer Synagoge auf Long Island wieder zusammengesetzt. Hier befindet es sich auch heute noch.  Br&Atilde;&acute; und ich malten auf Pressfaserplatten, die wir eigenh&Atilde;&curren;ndig mit einem Handwagen durch Paris zogen. Wir verwendeten Kaseinfarben, die wir selbst herstellten. Wir kauften jeden Tag frische Milch, lie&Atilde;en sie sauer werden, gerinnen und die Molke durch ein Seihtuch abtropfen, um Quark zu erhalten, den wir dann mit ungel&Atilde;&para;schtem Kalk mischten.  Das Ergebnis war ein Bindemittel mit starkem, bei&Atilde;endem Ammoniakgeruch, das wir wiederum mit den Farbpigmenten mischten.  Wir teilten uns die Arbeit in der Form, dass Br&Atilde;&acute; in genialer Weise vor allem die Formen mit schnell gezogenen Linien entwarf, und ich sorgf&Atilde;&curren;ltig die Zwischenr&Atilde;&curren;ume in eint&Atilde;&para;niger Kleinarbeit farbig ausmalte, obwohl Br&Atilde;&acute; manchmal die Farben &Atilde;&curren;nderte und ich Zeichnungen hinzuf&Atilde;&frac14;gte.  In dieser Zeit traf ich mit Br&Atilde;&acute; eine Vereinbarung. Br&Atilde;&acute; malte kreisrunde K&Atilde;&para;pfe mit Gesichtern, in denen weit oben mandelf&Atilde;&para;rmige Augen sa&Atilde;en, mit Nase, Fl&Atilde;&frac14;ssen und einem Mund in der Form eines Schiffes. Ich malte &quot;Seelen-B&Atilde;&curren;ume&quot;, die wie Menschen oder Heilige von einer Aureole umgeben waren. B&Atilde;&curren;ume, durch die man hindurchsehen konnte, als k&Atilde;&curren;men sie aus gl&Atilde;&curren;sernen Welten. Diese B&Atilde;&curren;ume hatte ich in den Zeichnungen Walter Kampmanns gesehen. Br&Atilde;&acute; erlaubte mir, seine Gesichter zu zeichnen, und er durfte meine &quot;Seelen-B&Atilde;&curren;ume&quot; malen.   Manuskript f&Atilde;&frac14;r einen Beitrag im Kat.

Doch wir sind nicht mehr f&Atilde;&curren;hig, die Regentropfen, die auf unser Gesicht fallen, zu z&Atilde;&curren;hlen... Wir distanzieren uns von der Erde, indem wir hochm&Atilde;&frac14;tig auf Sesseln sitzen, wir sch&Atilde;&curren;men uns der Spr&Atilde;&frac14;nge, die sich auf dem Wiener Trottoir bilden, der Zeichen, die uns die Erde wiederbringen, die uns an das Leben wiederanschlie&Atilde;en, das wir versto&Atilde;en haben.&quot;  (Brief an Wiener Kritiker, verfa&Atilde;t 1953, aus: Kat. Museum Ludwig, K&Atilde;&para;ln, 1980, S. 109f.) Damals hatte ich mich mit einem Kritiker in Wien gerauft. Ich wollte, um ihm den Tachismus begreiflich zu machen - das war 1952, ziemlich lange her - beweisen, wie sch&Atilde;&para;n es w&Atilde;&curren;re, wenn der Regen rote Tropfen fallen lie&Atilde;e. Das w&Atilde;&curren;re besonders deutlich, wenn die roten Regentropfen auf eine wei&Atilde;e Limousine fallen und dann gelbe Bahnen zur&Atilde;&frac14;cklassen. Das hatte dieser Kritiker aber so aufgefa&Atilde;t, als h&Atilde;&curren;tte ich ihn veranlassen wollen, mit dem Pyjama hinauszulaufen, jedesmal wenn es zu regnen anf&Atilde;&curren;ngt, um sich die Regentupfen anzusehen. Man kann vom Regen lernen: Wenn es regnet, soll man doch hinausgehen auf die Stra&Atilde;e und sein Gesicht so halten, da&Atilde; die Regentropfen auf das Gesicht fallen. Die Regentropfen, die auf das Gesicht fallen, soll man z&Atilde;&curren;hlen, und da wird man ein Gl&Atilde;&frac14;cksgef&Atilde;&frac14;hl empfinden - besonders bei den ersten Regentropfen. Der Kritiker hat das aber falsch aufgefa&Atilde;t. Er hat gemeint, ich w&Atilde;&frac14;rde ihn frotzeln und er solle mit dem Pyjama rauslaufen. Er hat nicht begriffen, da&Atilde; ich etwas Ernstes meinte. Ich wollte nur einen Einf&Atilde;&frac14;hrungsunterricht in Tachismus erteilen. Da ich nie ein Tachist war, hatte ich nat&Atilde;&frac14;rlich auf meine eigene Art und Weise versucht, mit dem Problem des Tachismus fertig zu werden. Diese roten Patzen auf dem Bild sind nicht heruntergefallene Farbe, sondern sie sind gemalt. Ich habe wohl die innersten Tropfen einfach so fallen lassen, das schon, aber die Umrandungen der einzelnen Tropfen sind gemalt. Auf dem Bild ist eine wei&Atilde;e Limousine von oben gesehen, etwa vom ersten Stock eines Geb&Atilde;&curren;udes. Mann sieht genau, wie die Tropfen sich abzeichnen auf dem Dach der Limousine und auf dem Trottoir. Der K&Atilde;&frac14;hler, die vier R&Atilde;&curren;der und die Fenster des Autos sind sichtbar - und die Bahnen, die die Regentropfen nehmen. Damals habe ich mich mit dem Problem des Tachismus auseinandergesetzt. Ich hielt ihn f&Atilde;&frac14;r einen gro&Atilde;en Wendepunkt. Ich bin aber nie dem Tachismus verfallen, sondern ich habe ihn so gel&Atilde;&para;st wie hier. Ich bin der Ansicht, da&Atilde; der Regen vollkommener Tachismus ist. Nur leider sieht man das nicht richtig, denn wenn es l&Atilde;&curren;nger regnet, wird alles gleichf&Atilde;&para;rmig na&Atilde;. Wenn man aber den Regen rot f&Atilde;&curren;rben und nach den ersten Tropfen den Regen unterbrechen k&Atilde;&para;nnte, h&Atilde;&curren;tte man eine perfekte tachistische Formenlehre.

Endlich war es soweit und ich bekam ein Ausstellungsfaltblatt mit Farbreproduktionen! Obwohl ich den Rat Facchettis &quot;Soyez gentil avec Monsieur Alvard&quot; nicht befolgte, schrieb dieser einen wundervollen Katalogtext.  Das Bild war meine erste in &Atilde;l gemalte Spirale. Der Ansto&Atilde; dazu war eine unregelm&Atilde;&curren;&Atilde;ig sich drehende Spirale in einem Dokumentarfilm von Fulchignioni. Die Spirale wurde im H&Atilde;&acute;pital Saint Anne in Paris aufgenommen, und ich sah den Film an der Wiener Universit&Atilde;&curren;t. Diese Spirale, ich glaube in Blau und Rot, hat meinem Schaffen den entscheidenden Impuls gegeben. Mir wurde schwindlig bei der Erkenntnis, da&Atilde; die unregelm&Atilde;&curren;&Atilde;ige Spirale das Hauptgleichnis f&Atilde;&frac14;r Leben und Tod ist.').

Das Punktesystem zur Verrechnung der Bilder war damals zwischen H&Atilde;&curren;ndlern und Malern &Atilde;&frac14;blich. Die H&Atilde;&curren;ndler kauften nicht nach Qualit&Atilde;&curren;t, sondern nach Fl&Atilde;&curren;chengr&Atilde;&para;&Atilde;e. Es hie&Atilde;, der und der Maler ist soundso viel Punkte wert. Dieses Ma&Atilde;- und Rechnungssystem war von Keilrahmen- und Leinwandherstellern &Atilde;&frac14;bernommen worden. Je gr&Atilde;&para;&Atilde;er das Bild, um so gr&Atilde;&para;&Atilde;er die Punkte pro Fl&Atilde;&curren;che, also ein doppelt so gro&Atilde;es Bild hatte nicht doppelt so viele Punkte, sondern etwa um die H&Atilde;&curren;lfte mehr Punkte. Au&Atilde;erdem gab es Formate: Figure (waren die breitesten), Paysage (schm&Atilde;&curren;ler), Marine (die schm&Atilde;&curren;lsten). Ein Marine hatte die gleichen Punkte wie ein ebenso langes Figure. Ein fauler Maler, der nach Punkten an H&Atilde;&curren;ndler verkauft, brauchte also nur Marine zu malen, da er weniger Fl&Atilde;&curren;che zu bemalen hatte.

paint_hundertwasser_comment_en(228,'Ich hatte eine Viele-Punkte-Strategie, um in Paris ohne Geld zu leben und zu malen. 1. Ich hatte vierzehn Freunde und bekannte Familien, die mich jeweils einmal pro Woche zum Mittag- oder Abendessen einluden. Das konnte ich auch auf alle vierzehn Tage strecken; so fiel ich niemandem zur Last, und habe dies auch nie konsequent gemacht. 2. Ich habe nie Essen aus Mistk&Atilde;&frac14;beln genommen, wohl aber Material, Packpapiere, Sperrholzplatten und Stoffreste, die ich zu Kleidern, Schuhen und Schlafsack umgestaltete. 3. Wenn ich Punkt Mittag auf einen der offenen Pariser M&Atilde;&curren;rkte ging, so wurde alles, was nicht verkauft wurde und in Gefahr stand, schlecht zu werden, auf die Stra&Atilde;e geworfen. Die Kunst bestand darin, diese Nahrungsmittel - haupts&Atilde;&curren;chlich Obst - schnell einzusammeln, bevor die unfreundlichen Stra&Atilde;enkehrer mit den Besen auf die Finger schlugen. 4. Von Br&Atilde;&acute; lernte ich, vom Weizen zu leben. Mit einem Kilogramm Weizen vom Bauern oder billig als H&Atilde;&frac14;hnerfutter oder Saatgut erworben, konnte ich eine Woche leben. Ich konnte daraus machen: Weizensuppe, Brot, Weizengaletten, Weizenkaffee und Weizenkeimsalat. Weizen unterlag dem Staatsmonopol so wie Tabak. Damit man nicht auf den Gedanken kommt, mit Weizen f&Atilde;&frac14;r nur eine Mark pro Monat (oder so ungef&Atilde;&curren;hr) zu leben, war der Weizen f&Atilde;&frac14;r Vieh rot oder blau gef&Atilde;&curren;rbt. Ich fuhr einmal mit dem Fahrrad zum n&Atilde;&curren;chsten Bauern hinter St. Maur, bekam f&Atilde;&frac14;r einen Tag Kartoffelklauben f&Atilde;&frac14;nf Kilogramm Weizen, mit dem ich monatelang auskam. 5. Zu Gratis-Wohlt&Atilde;&curren;tigkeitsausspeisungen, z.B. im Palais Royal, von k&Atilde;&frac14;nstlerliebenden Damen finanziert, bin ich nur selten gegangen. 6. Vor den Pariser Caf&Atilde;&copy;s, z.B. dem &quot;Deux Margot&quot;, stand ich so lange, bis mich jemand kannte und zum Tisch einlud. Nachher bat ich um etwa zwanzig Cents (zehn Pfennig), nie mehr, was man mir bereitwillig gab. Da ich kein Geld ausgab, hatte ich mit der Zeit dennoch immer mehr Geld. 7. Bei Besuchen bat ich auch um etwas Salz, Zucker oder &Atilde;l, nie mehr, als um eine leere Fotoh&Atilde;&frac14;lse zu f&Atilde;&frac14;llen, was man mir stets erstaunt, aber bereitwillig gab. 8. Weggeworfene harte Baguettes in Wasser aufgeweicht und ger&Atilde;&para;stet, wurden wie frisches Brot. 9. Ich borgte ein Fahrrad von der Familie Dumage (die Metro war zu teuer) und wohnte in einem nicht benutzten Abstellraum, in einer nicht benutzten Garage. 10. Gewaltma&Atilde;nahmen, wie sie mir Kiki Kogelnik erz&Atilde;&curren;hlte, unternahm ich nie: Arnulf Rainer f&Atilde;&frac14;hrte Kiki in ein Nobelrestaurant der Champs Elysee zum Essen und sagte: &quot;Ich nehme die rechte, du die linke Seite&quot;. Sie rannten von Tisch zu Tisch, um die Speisereste, die noch auf den Tellern lagen, in sich hineinzustopfen, bevor die Ober abr&Atilde;&curren;umten. Bevor man reagieren konnte, waren sie wieder drau&Atilde;en. Mit diesen funktionierenden Selbsterhaltungsstrategien wollte ich mein Leben leben und war eigentlich sehr ungehalten und gar nicht froh, als jemand ein Bild kaufen wollte. Als ich mehrmals ablehnte - ich wollte unbedingt diesen gl&Atilde;&frac14;cklichen und autarken Zustand verl&Atilde;&curren;ngern, der etwa 10 Jahre anhielt - bekam ich den Ruf, gesch&Atilde;&curren;ftst&Atilde;&frac14;chtig zu sein. Dabei wollte ich nur beweisen, da&Atilde; man ohne Geld leben kann, schon wegen meiner Mutter, die immer sagte: &quot;Malen ist ein Hungerleiderberuf&quot;. Als ich meinen ersten Vertrag mit Kamer hatte, schrieb ich in den Ausstellungskatalog der Galerie St. Stephan: &quot;Malen ist kein Hungerleiderberuf, denn man kann damit schnell reich werden. Mit dem Geld, das ich in Frankreich mit meiner Malerei verdiente, habe ich mir ein Haus und ein Auto gekauft&quot;. Als ich das bewiesen hatte, war Geld f&Atilde;&frac14;r mich wie schon zuvor nicht mehr interessant, es sei denn als Wertsch&Atilde;&curren;tzung meines Anliegens, sp&Atilde;&curren;ter f&Atilde;&frac14;r Naturfreik&Atilde;&curren;ufe und zur Unterst&Atilde;&frac14;tzung von Architekturen, wenn das Budget &Atilde;&frac14;berschritten war.

Wenn ich ein Bild beginne und nicht wei&Atilde;, was ich malen soll, dann fange ich entweder mit einer Spirale oder mit einem Haus an. Hier habe ich eine Erfindung dazugebracht: die Fenster als W&Atilde;&curren;rmflasche. Die Wiener Fenster aus den sechziger Jahren haben meistens oben &Atilde;&frac14;ber dem Fenster einen Stuckaufsatz. Die Fenster sehen dadurch, wenn sie gemalt sind, wie W&Atilde;&curren;rmflaschen aus. Ich habe mich damals schon mit Architektur besch&Atilde;&curren;ftigt; ich h&Atilde;&curren;tte es am liebsten, wenn die H&Atilde;&curren;user nicht alle gleich w&Atilde;&curren;ren, wenn vielmehr die Fenster verschiedene Gr&Atilde;&para;&Atilde;en h&Atilde;&curren;tten - so wie afrikanische H&Atilde;&curren;user.

In Italien und in anderen romanischen L&Atilde;&curren;ndern ist das leider eine ganz schreckliche Krankheit, da&Atilde; man Aquarelle nicht f&Atilde;&frac14;r vollwertig empfindet, sondern nur &Atilde;lbilder. Wenn man ein Aquarell hat, mu&Atilde; man es unbedingt in ein &Atilde;lbild verwandeln. Ich glaube, die Italiener haben das auch mit Klee gemacht. Das ist ganz entsetzlich.

Ich will ja nicht sehr auffallen. Wenn ein Maler irgendwo im Kaffeehaus ein gro&Atilde;es Papier ausbreitet und zu malen beginnt, so f&Atilde;&curren;llt das furchtbar auf.

Da f&Atilde;&frac14;r mich die Spirale ein Symbol der Sonne ist und das Haus ein Symbol des Mondes, habe ich in die Mitte der Spirale Gold aufgelegt und in die Mitte des Hauses ein silbernes Fenster gemalt. Ich habe hier zum ersten Mal eine Spirale in Komplement&Atilde;&curren;rfarben gemalt. Das hei&Atilde;t also: Von der Mitte her beginnend habe ich mit einem Rot-Gr&Atilde;&frac14;n-Kontrast gemalt. Wenn sich nun die rote Spirale nach au&Atilde;en dreht, wird sie langsam lila und blau und gr&Atilde;&frac14;n, und zu dieser Linie habe ich immer die jeweilige Komplement&Atilde;&curren;rfarbe gesetzt. Ich bezeichne oft die Bilder an verschiedenen Ecken, um deutlich auszudr&Atilde;&frac14;cken, da&Atilde; man sie verschieden h&Atilde;&curren;ngen kann.

In Japan zum Beispiel, wo das Aufstehen und Niedersetzten ja so kompliziert ist, hatte ich ein System, gro&Atilde;e Bilder zu malen: Ich legte auf den Tisch ein Buch, auf dem das gro&Atilde;e Bild rotieren konnte, so wie eine Scheibe, so weit der Arm reichte, hin zur Bildmitte, so weit konnte ich das Bild beherrschen und bemalen. Richtig habe ich das Bild erst dann gesehen, als es fertig war - erst, wenn ich die Gelegenheit hatte, aufzustehen und es senkrecht zu stellen.

Waldviertel, Epiphany, 1970 Dear Maria Bilger,  I had hoped you would be tactful enough and I wouldn&#039;t have to say it. But as you keep insisting, I must write you that you will not be getting my watercolour for 2 reasons.  1. For the exhibition of Hundertwasser pictures with Schidlo-Riedl you cut up my watercolour &quot;OASIS AFTER THE TALE OF THAIB BEN THAMI&quot;, work no. 115, without my consent, without my knowledge. I only got the middle portion of it back, but to date not the cut-off edges. I must insist on your returning the cut-off pieces, though it is questionable whether a restorer can put the cut pieces together again. So I think this cutting cannot be repaired. I do not understand how you, an artist, can treat others&#039; works of art this way. 2. The watercolour &quot;Weeping Man with Hat&quot; I was able to save; without my efforts it would have been lost. When I asked about this painting so I could photograph it you couldn&#039;t remember where it was; in your former flat on Karlsplatz, which you had already vacated by that time, all that was left was rubbish to be thrown away. Everything you considered worth the trouble of taking with you was gone. What remained was supposed to be thrown out by the new tenant, who was already moving in. There were piles of paper for recycling, boxes, sketches, everything to be trown away, and somewhere in all this, amongst worthless posters, my painting. With the picture facing the wall, indicating that you liked the reverse side better than the &quot;Weeping Man&quot;, horribly fixed to the wall with thumbtacks and scotch tape, faded and with stains from water leaking from the ceiling. Or these stains were (are) so bad that they are maybe coffee stains or something.  Such is the damage: 1. Streaks of stain over the whole painting going all the way through the paper. 2. Damage from thumbtacks and scotch tape. 3. Fading of the reverse side, also painted, probably from the sun (blue paper turned brown).  I brought the watercolour to the restorer Caspar, who spent a year trying to save the painting. He gave it back to me, stating that the damage is so great that it cannot be restored! You will understand that I cannot entrust a watercolour of mine to someone who lets it go to ruin in such a way and also put it in the rubbish for the dustbin. If I had not intervened, it would have long since landed in the garbage dump. Here, too, I cannot understand how you, an artist, can treat the works of your colleagues in this way. If you had bought the painting, perhaps you would have been more careful with it. Probably. You know how attched I am to my paintings. Here my artistic pride has been trodden on. Anyway. A woman who abuses a child and then throws it away also loses any right to the child, especially when it isn&#039;t hers, but is just one she has been entrusted with.

Our days, it is rare that two independent artists join to create a work of art together out of pure enthusiasm. I have collaborated with Br&Atilde;&acute; in two large murals 96 PARADISE - LAND OF MEN, OF TREES, BIRDS AND SHIPS and 97 THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT.  96 PARADISE - LAND OF MEN, OF TREES, BIRDS AND SHIPS We painted directly on a wall with glue paint. We have been influenced by the big murals in the Toscana (Giotto, Paolo Uccello) and by the murals of the papal residence of Avignon. We wanted to create something equally phantastic and important.  The second mural   97  THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT we decided not to paint directly on the walls but on panels which could be moved away, when the old hunting pavilion in which we painted it would be destroyed which was the case some years later.  The house was the old hunting pavilion of Napoleon III situated on the border of the Bois de Vincennes in Paris where Napoleon met with his mistress, la comtesse de Castiglione. I lived and painted in this pavilion as guest of the Dumage family for about ten years. When this pavilion was destroyed in the 1960s, the wall on which the mural was painted was cut in pieces by Prof. Licata, then transported to America in a container and reassembled in a Synagogue on Long Island where it is today.  The mural I painted with Br&Atilde;&acute; on pressed fibre board which we carried ourselves through Paris with  hand chart. We used the casein-technique which we prepared ourselves. We bought every day fresh milk, let it turn sour and curdle, let the liquid whey drop through a cheesecloth to obtain cottage cheese which we then mixed with unslaked lime.  This way, we obtained a glue with a strong pungent ammoniac smell with which we mixed the powder colours.  We divided the work in the way that Br&Atilde;&acute; mostly designed the forms like a genius with quickly drawn lines, and I painstakingly coloured between the lines slowly and in tedious work, though Br&Atilde;&acute;, from time to time, changed colours himself and I added drawings.  In that time, I made a deal with Br&Atilde;&acute;. Br&Atilde;&acute; painted almond-shaped eyes high up in the face with nose, rivers and ship-mouth in circular-shaped heads. I painted soul-trees that means trees which had a halo of glory like human beings and saints. Trees where you could see through as if they were made out of spheres of glass. These trees I had seen in the drawings of Walter Kampmann. Br&Atilde;&acute; gave me the right to paint his faces, and I gave Br&Atilde;&acute; the right to paint my &quot;soul-trees&quot;.

I never painted a picture in the hut of a Styrian alpine pasture in such a state of enthusiasm. I was afraid I would ruin it by overpainting and left some parts unfinished. For the first time I used the painting technique of shading the edges. I think this is the painting Wolfgang Hutter saw at the Christmas exhibition &quot;Good Pictures for Everyone&quot;, where it was on sale for 300 schillings, and he nominated me to be a new member of the Art Club, to which I was admitted one year later. It can thus be justifiably said that it was Wolfgang Hutter who was the first to discover me for the world of art. Hutter is only two days younger than I.

It seemed incredible that somebody who had attended the Academy intentionally painted like a child. That was during my first exhibition at the Vienna Art Club in 1952. I wanted somehow to express my commitment to being a European and to the tradition of our culture. I also began to make a point of writing with pen and ink in the old German script. Paintings often have sad stories to tell. Especially this one. I sold it to Peggy Guggenheim for 100 dollars, assuming it would become a part of the Guggenheim Collection in Venice. Years later, when I wanted to exhibit the painting, Peggy told me she had given it to her daughter Peggeen because her grandchild (while still a baby) loved it so much that he played with the watercolour and tore it to pieces. I fetched the scraps of paper, had the painting restored and framed at my expense and gave it back to Peggy, again in the hope that it would be put in her collection.

paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(74,'Part of my answer to the Viennese critic J&Atilde;&para;rg Lampe, who absolutely would not understand the meaning of my painting. &quot;Have you ever thought of this: if the rain fell in red drops and the painter or person ran outside with festive heart, spread out a white piece of paper and listened to the rhythm of the falling drops with their own ears and were witnesses of the supreme law with their own eyes . . .But we are no longer capable of counting the raindrops which fall on our face . . . We distance ourselves from the earth by haughtily sitting on chairs; we are ashamed of the cracks which form on Vienna&#039;s sidewalks, of the signs the earth brings back to us, which re-connect us to life, which we have rejected.&quot; (Letter to a Viennese Critic, written in 1953, from: Cat. Museum Ludwig, Cologne, 1980, p. 109f.) At the time I was having a dispute with a critic in Vienna. To make Tachism  comprehensible to him - this was in 1952, quite a long time ago - I wanted to prove how beautiful it would be if the rain fell in red drops. That would be especially clear if the red raindrops fell on a white limousine and left behind yellow rivulets. But this critic had taken it to mean that I wanted to make him run outside in his pyjamas every time it started to rain, to look at the spots the rain made. You can learn from the rain: when it rains you should go out in the street and position your head so the raindrops fall on your face. You should count the raindrops that fall on your face, and then you will experience the feeling of joy - especially at the first raindrops. But the critic took this the wrong way. He thought I was making fun of him and wanted him to run outside in his pyjamas. He couldn&#039;t comprehend that I was talking about something solemn. I just wanted to give him introductory instruction in Tachism. Since I was never a Tachist, I of course tried in my own way to come to grips with the problem of Tachism. These red splotches on the picture are not spilled paint, they are painted. I probably did let the core of the drops simply drop onto the paper, sure, but the edging around the individual drops is painted. In the picture a white limousine is seen from above, from the first storey of a building, say. You can see precisely how the drops stand out against the roof of the limousine and on the sidewalk. The bonnet, the four wheels and the windows of the car are visible - and the rivulets which the raindrops form. At the time I was pre-occupied with the problem of Tachism. I felt it was a major turning point. But I never succumbed to Tachism, I solved it like here in this picture. I am of the opinion that rain is Tachism to perfection. Only people don&#039;t see that correctly, unfortunately, for when it rains longer, everything gets equally wet. But if you could colour rain red and interrupt the rain after the first drops, you would have a perfect Tachistic doctrine of form. (from: Hundertwasser, Buchheim Verlag, Feldafing, 1964, p. 34)').

paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(103,'I painted on the extended Lido of Venice - the Lido is a long island. It begins with the Lido as such and goes down to Chioggia. But the Lido is separated from the other island by a channel. The first town on the other island is called San Pietro in Volta, then comes Palestrina, and between San Pietro and Palestrina is a long, slender stretch of land where vintners are. Back then I didn&#039;t have much money, and when I came to Venice I immediately proceeded to Sant&#039; Elena and from there crossed over with the vaporetto. Then I went on foot until there were no more houses and lay down to sleep in the sand or got into ahut and slept there. Then I lived for a time in such a hut. The picture is called &quot;The Calculation&quot; because I then had, I think, 12,000 lire. I had resolved to live there three months, so I had to divide the 12,000 lire by 90 - 90 days - and that meant that I could spend 133 lire per day. I wrote that down on the paper. And around that I wound this picture. After a few days the vintner came by. He was very nice. Instead of being angry, he always gave me grapes and something to eat, too, and it was a very happy time for me. I did not stay three months, at that, but I was there a long time.

Just about every day a patient died. The prayers of the nuns - they all had to join in the singing - echoed like in a big cathedral. I painted most assiduously in bed and began to give my pictures titles and to number them in my head - it was my first &Acirc;uvre catalogue, for which I wrote important texts, treatises, philosophy - I was never so industrious. Before that I had been ill. (I lived with the painters Peverelli and Giorgio de Gaspari, an ingenious draughtsman and terrific person who became a good friend thirty years later in Palestrina.) My urine was black and my stool white. The Austrian Consulate was unwilling to help this vagabond who had just popped up. A doctor finally referred me to the Vatican. The Church saved my life twice. The first time it was the Merciful Brothers (Barmherzige Br&Atilde;&frac14;der) in Vienna in 1945, and then the Vatican Hospital in Rome. I have to say that every time somebody starts criticising the Catholic Church and its institutions. An opened envelope is an arrow. In the arrow itself there are contradictory tendencies, which by no means always go in the direction of the arrow. For this to develop to a direction for the arrow at all, untold inward cramps are necessary.').
paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(109,'I painted this in bed. I had jaundice in Rome, and I was never more industrious and feverishly active than in this hospital bed. By the time my illness was over, I had ten fantastic drawings finished. It was so terrifically convenient that they brought the meals to my bed, and beverages, and that the paints were lying ready beside me. This is one of those pictures. I had a special ground then, not a vinyl-acetate ground, but one of lime, a lime-chalk ground. As I always have some material with me just in case, I even had a number of sheets of this prepared paper with me while I was a hospital patient. With the flower at the upper right - the colours are a little different than those of the other flowers - no ground had been applied. The paper is a yellow Italian market paper, the kind that was actually used as wrapping for fruit. I am very anxious that the picture will completely disintegrate someday, but it&#039;s still holding up, although it has changed hands often thus far. It is always terribly painful for me when I don&#039;t know where my pictures are. I really suffer great torment. Of the pictures I have painted there are about 50 that I don&#039;t know where they are. Often I have anguished dreams because I don&#039;t where this or that picture is. I think I would do the most foolhardy things and make any sacrifice to know where this or that picture is. I have already written thousands of letters to find out where certain pictures are. I can&#039;t imagine that other painters don&#039;t have this nagging feeling, too - I can only imagine it if other painters have no deep relationship with their pictures and just paint and don&#039;t care if they never see them again. - Really, I can&#039;t. - Maybe it&#039;s a mania with me: when I paint now I already think of all the hardship a picture will go through someday. That&#039;s why I have such a hard time parting with a picture. Not because I like it so much myself. I am willing to part with pictures, but I would like to know where they are. I don&#039;t want to keep pictures myself, I just want to be informed as to where they are and how they are.

The name of a picture must never express what can be seen in the picture as it is, but should be a continuation of the picture with other means. Moreover, the more complex a picture is, the more associations it permits. These are layers of consciousness that have to be turned like pages in order to look at such a picture, and besides, other people often find better names for the picture than the painter himself. At any rate, in coming up with a name, a similar mechanism is brought to bear as in the intuitive creation of the picture.').

Only rarely did I paint the normal way like other painters, with oil on canvas (see also 279 Tree Rocket of the Ancient Masters) In print graphics it was similar. I maintained a spatial separation of the techniques: copperplate engraving in Vienna, lithography in Paris, silkscreen printing and metallic-stamp printing in Venice and woodcut in Japan. Often I mixed these techniques with one another, and moreover I was probably the only one who used metallic stamping, phosphorus and reflecting substances.

paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(227,'My exclusive contract with Galerie Kamer stipulated that I was to hand in seventy points per month, for which I got 70,000 (old) francs (700 francs after revaluation). The point system for keeping tabs on pictures was customary between dealers and painters at that time. Dealers bought not according to quality, but area. They would say, such-and-such a painter is worth so-and-so many  points. This system of measurement and calculation had been adapted from the makers of wedged stretchers and canvasses. The bigger the picture the more points it had per unit of area, i. e., a picture double the size of another did not have twice the amount of points, but about half again as many. Moreover, there were formats: figure (these were the widest), paysage (less wide), marine (the slenderest). A marine had the same number of points as an equally tall figure. So a lazy painter who sold to dealers by the point system only needed to paint marines, since then there would be less area to paint. To paint seventy points I either had to paint a lot of small pictures or one big one, but its area would be about twice as big as the combined area of the small ones. Obviously, this system is not conducive to producing quality. The point quota had to be met. If quality could not be maintained, the painter was eliminated and replaced by another. After all, there were 60,000 painters in Paris who declared painting as their occupation. When I went to renew my residency permit and told a civil servant at the Prefecture that I had a contract with a gallery, she got very angry because so many French painters were out of work.

paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(228,'I had a multi-faceted strategy for living and painting in Paris with no money. 1. I had fourteen friends and families I knew who invited me to a noon or evening meal once a week. I could also stretch it to once a fortnight; this way I was not a burden to anyone, and I was consistent about never becoming one. 2. I never took food from dustbins, but I did material: packing paper, plywood panels and cloth remnants, which I turned into clothes, shoes and a sleeping bag. 3. If I went to one of the open-air markets in Paris at the stroke of noon, everything that was not sold and was in danger of spoiling was thrown onto the street. The trick to this was to quickly gather up this food - fruit for the most part - before the unfriendly street sweepers smacked your fingers with their brooms. 4. From Br&Atilde;&acute; I learned to live on wheat. With one kilogramme of wheat from a farmer or cheaply purchased as chicken feed or seed, I could live a week. With it I could make: wheat soup, bread, wheat cakes, wheat coffee and wheat-germ salad. Wheat was subject to state monopoly, like tobacco. To keep people from trying to live off wheat for only one mark per month (or about that), wheat for livestock was dyed red or blue. Once I rode my bicycle to the nearest farmer, out beyond St. Maur, and got five kilogrammes of wheat for digging potatoes all day, and that was enough for several months. 5. I only rarely went to charity meals, for example in the Palais Royal, put on by ladies who took an interest in artists. 6. I stood in front of the Parisian caf&Atilde;&copy;s, Les Deux Margots, for example, until somebody who knew me invited me to sit down at their table. Afterwards I asked for twenty centimes (ten pfennigs), say, never for more, which was willingly given me. Since I did not spend any money, after a while I had more and more money in spite of everything. 7. When I visited someone, I also asked for a little salt, sugar or oil, never more than would fill an empty film case, which surprised people, but was always willingly given. 8. Discarded hard french bread, when soaked in water and then roasted, was like fresh bread. 9. I borrowed a bicycle from the Dumage family (the Metro was too expensive) and lived in an unused storeroom in an unused garage. 10.  I never resorted to sensational steps such as the one Kiki Kogelnik told me about: Arnulf Rainer took Kiki to dinner at a posh restaurant on the Champs Elys&Atilde;&copy;es and said, &quot;I&#039;ll take the right side, you take the left&quot;. They ran from table to table, stuffing themselves with the leftovers still on the plates before the waiters cleared the table. Before the latter could react, the two were outside again. With these feasible survival strategies I wanted to live my life and was actually very upset and not at all happy that somebody wanted to buy a picture. When I refused several times - I wanted to extend this happy and self-sufficient state, which went on for about ten years - I got the reputation of being a shrewd businessman. And at that I only wanted to prove that you can live without money, if only bccause of my mother, who always said, &quot;Painting is a profesion for starvelings&quot;. When I had my first contract with Kamer, I wrote in the exhibition catalogue of St. Stephen&#039;s Gallery, &quot;Painting is not a profession for starvelings, for one can get rich quickly doing it. With the money I earned in France with my painting I bought a house and a car for myself.&quot; After proving this, money was no longer of interest to me, just as before, except as a sign of appreciation of my endeavours, later for acquiring plots in nature to save them and for supporting architectural projects when the budget had been exceeded.

When I painted it I wasn&#039;t actually thinking of an eye, but of the matte and shiny portions. I had done the painting with watercolours and coated it with a varnish that would let the watercolours really shine through. Then I painted the dark portions onto the varnish and smeared them afterwards in the middle. The middle surfaces of the watercolour portions have less varnish, so that the matte and shiny parts are connected - depending on whether they had been painted with water or oil technique. I also included gold in this painting. At the time I had begun to use gold more and more frequently, irregardless of the fact that painting with gold was thought to be childish. Probably thanks to my &quot;ancestors&quot; Schiele and Klimt, who also used gold a lot, I had no qualms at all about using this material and pasting genuine gold foil onto the surface. At the time I didn&#039;t yet know how to apply it properly. That lent the pictures a particular attractiveness. Now, unfortunately, I know exactly how to apply the gold, and now the results are no longer such beautifully ragged surfaces. The title The Eye Balance came later, as so often. When a painting like this one is finished, I try like everything to think up a title. Title is not right; name is better - just like you say to people Franz, Joseph, or Annemarie, I called the painting Eye Balance. It is an eye suspended anatomically by its tendons, but it can also mean something different, something entirely different. I worked a bit faster on this painting.

He would then organise an exhibition with pictures by famous painters which had been painted under the influence of this new drug, including pictures by Michaux, Picasso and me. I agreed, since it would be under the supervision of a doctor, and he took me straight to St. Anne&#039;s Hospital (the one where Fulchignioni had shot the spiral film which influenced me so much). A doctor gave me a handful of white pills and a glass of water. I asked where the other painters were. They told me I was the first one, but by then it was too late: I had already swallowed the pills. It was a white room with a bed, a table, a chair and a lamp hanging from the ceiling. I unpacked my painting utensils - primed paper, watercolours, brush, water glass - ready to paint when the &quot;trip&quot; began. Jouffroy and the doctor left me alone. I waited with brush in hand, but soon I felt so horribly nauseous that I could only lie down on the bed. The doctor came and asked if I saw, heard, felt anything. I said, &quot;I just feel sick.&quot; The room had a high ceiling. I was alone again. I remembered I had come there to paint so that I could be part of an important exhibition. With utmost willpower I staggered over to the table, held my painting hand with the other, because I couldn&#039;t move it, laid my shoulder on the paper and drew the outline and then a &quot;portrait&quot; of Jouffroy, who came in from time to time. As the pills wore off I could work better. The pictures only seemed different because I was half paralyzed physically, not because I had had hallucinations. Afterwards I even drove Jouffroy to Place de la Contrescarpe with my own car, a bright-red Renault Dauphine, and that was where the streetlights were so beautiful. I gave Alain both watercolours. He did not organise an exhibition and even sold both pictures. I never took drugs again.').

paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(325,'Originally the painting was two watercolours, two parts: an upper and a lower part. I put them together and sold them to a collector in Hamburg. It was not a particularly beautiful picture until I finished painting it later, the way it is shown here. After it was finished, I thought a long time about the name and finally came up with The Heart of the Revolution. By that I did not mean a wild revolution, but one which slowly spreads, kind of a vegetative revolution, a kind of evolution. I can leave a painting untouched for years, often three, four, five years, and suddenly I finish it. This is a painting I am particularly fond of. I think the title is a good choice. It really is a heart that is beating. Unfortunately the technique cannot be made out in the colour reproduction. The picture is painted partly with water technique and partly in oil. The result is that parts of the painting are matte and others shiny. That gives the painting a fascination of its own, by virtue of the contrast, not just that of complementary colours such as red and green, but also the contrast of matte and shiny surfaces. That, I think, is a specialty of mine. (from: Hundertwasser, Buchheim Verlag, Feldafing, 1964, p. 14)').

The year I had spent in Morocco and Tunesia proved to be a decisive influence in this. Arab music, the crookedness of Arab houses, Arab hospitality, Arab colourfulness and frugality, Arab respect for the printed page, the gardens of paradise and much more left their stamp on me for good. Later Buddhism and the world of the Hindu gods impressed me. I show penises in my works, but never belittlingly, e.g., in 622 Mourning Schiele, 792 Love Is Something, but also in the towering chimneys of Spittelau and Osaka. On the main portal of St. Stephen&#039;s in Vienna a huge penis can be made out, too.').

I only got a small share of the list price, with the explanation that Peggy Guggenheim had only paid a fraction of the price. But from her I learned that she had had to pay many times more than the list price. So I paid Peggy Guggenheim the difference she had been cheated out of from my own pocket. For I was pedantically keen on keeping my prices steady. They were not supposed to get too high or too low. I even went to court if dealers asked too much. And this was never because of my share. My colleagues thought I was crazy to keep higher prices down at all costs. But I knew exactly what I was doing.').
paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(372,'To me the most honest form of Tachism was total self-renunciation: if a painter climbs up a ladder with a bucket of paint and shoots himself up there, letting the paint fall &quot;automatically&quot; onto the canvas waiting on the floor, that is the most sublime act of Tachistic self-renunciation. The canvas is like a jumping sheet, the paint sticks to it, the dead initiator falls through it. Painting blind- blindfolded - or drawing left-handed - when you&#039;re right-handed - are not so totally honest, and when you let snails, monkeys, donkey tails, elephant trunks do the painting, it is somebody else doing the work, albeit Tachistically correctly. With this picture I wanted to show very lucidly and immediately and precisely how a Tachistically fluidoid-spiraloid painting done in a state of complete awareness looks as if it were from a different viewpoint, a different time and world, when it is painted with the traditional method. I had great respect for Tachism, but as an outsider.').
paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(387,'The biggest picture I painted in Japan. I lived in a ryokan, a traditional Japanese inn, with armchairs without legs, a low table, only about high enough (approx. 40 cm) to stretch your legs through or to sit cross-legged before it or in a Roman reclining position on one&#039;s elbows. The floor was covered by tatami mats. The painting was on the little table, which was only about 70 cm square, and stuck far out in the room. As it was a difficult physical undertaking to stand up and paint at another point in the picture, I turned the painting horizontally around its midpoint and painted as far as the arm could reach. Thus the structural composition of the painting came about in a perfectly natural way and of itself, with a blue lake in the centre and a garden fence on the edge.').

paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(437,'The house is, I suppose, my favourite motif. With me it is like with Egon Schiele, the painter I love so much, who so liked to paint houses. If I start a picture and don&#039;t know what to paint, I start either with a spiral or a house. Here I have added an innovation: windows resembling hot-water bottles. The Viennese windows from the sixties usually have a plaster crown above the window. that makes the windows look like hot-water bottles when they&#039;re painted. I was already interested in architecture back then; I would have liked it best if the houses were not all alike, but had different-sized windows instead - like African houses. What I can&#039;t build, I paint, naturally. In the process I try to have the windows not only of different sizes and at different levels, but also to give them different crowns. Of course it shouldn&#039;t look chaotic; there should be real storeys and windows situated above or below one another. But the whole should be humane, in a word. - Green is my favourite colour. Why shouldn&#039;t a house be green? If the forest were slowly to disappear because the cities are getting bigger, then at least the houses would be green. I can well imagine green for a house - green ceramic tiles, for instance. Down below in the picture is a spiral as a cloud. Clouds are spirals to me. Anything can be a spiral: eyeglasses, clouds - everything can occur in spiral form. I think the house here is on fire. But I&#039;m not quite sure. I like it when houses are on fire.

We arranged a way to meet from our windows, using pieces of cloth; I crept into the garden, which belonged to a home for lay sisters, and painted this picture.').
paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(449,'Here I treated an architectural and also mystical problem. I am very fond of the onion. I have been told that in many countries the onion is revered as a deity. It is regarded as a fertility symbol. That is why onion turrets were built. As to the architecture itself, I am for an architecture which is not straight. And I can well imagine a church which is also a hill. Strange: a humpbacked person is thought to be ugly and somebody who isn&#039;t as beautiful. A church which has no hump is said to be beautiful, and a church which has one, ugly. - So I drew a humpy church which is particularly in need of affection - I put gold windows on it. The picture was done during a trip. The paper is irregular on the edges. I like irregular paper a lot and often paint the margin with extreme care, and to show that I set great store in the irregular edges I give it a particularly opulent margin, the way brocade is given an ornate hem. Intentionally, that is, for I have experienced horrible things: often irregular watercolours were cut into rectangles - and that&#039;s not all - they were also often pasted onto wood and canvas, too - and that&#039;s not all - they were also varnished, in order to sell them as oil paintings. In Italy and other Romance countries there is unfortunately a terrible disease: that watercolours don&#039;t count as much as oil paintings. If you have a watercolour, you have to change it into an oil painting by all means. I think the Italians did that with Klee, too. That is just horrible. A fruitful vandalism! It&#039;s odd that the watercolour is so cherished and highly regarded by the Germans and English, but not there. (from: Hundertwasser, Buchheim Verlag, Feldafing, 1964, p. 12) That houses and especially churches must have earth, grass, hills and trees on the roof, of that I was already firmly convinced. For too long the - probably erroneous - interpretation of the Bible &quot;And have dominion over the earth&quot; has held sway. It is time that we do the opposite: give territories back to the earth which we have misappropriated. Everything which is horizontal under the open sky belongs to nature. Later, when I planned a Catholic/Protestant integrative school with places of worship next to the day-care centre in Heddernheim in 1987 and made a model of it, the Bishop of Limburg thwarted construction with the words: &quot;Man, the crown of Creation, must not have earth above him&quot;.').
paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(451,'I often paint while travelling, and for this I prime packing or drawing paper with chalk and fold it into quarters or eighths so the paper takes up as little space as possible. Then I put the folded paper in my right jacket pocket and the watercolours in the left, and when I have time somewhere - if I have to wait, for example, for a visa at a consulate or for a woman at a caf&Atilde;&copy; - I take out the paper. I don&#039;t want to attract a lot of attention. When a painter spreads out a big sheet of paper in a caf&Atilde;&copy; somewhere and starts painting, that is very noticeable. But if somebody just takes out a small bit of paper that looks like this - no bigger than a letter envelope - people sitting off at a distance think the man is writing a letter or postcard. And then I ask for a glass of water and paint on the part lying face up. And then, when I am in another caf&Atilde;&copy;, I unfold another part of the paper - again with only a small portion showing. Thus, I often don&#039;t get a chance to see the whole surface; after all, I can&#039;t unfold the paper until I am home and can look at the whole picture in peace and quiet. In this way strange things often come about. In the case of this picture, it is very obvious that I painted four parts independently of one another. I do indeed strive to make the finished picture a unified whole - which means that when I paint one part I picture in my mind what has already been done on the rest, and I try to continue on with that. At the edges I also make some marks in order to know where I have to go on. And all the same, once I unfold the paper, the picture is so strange that it astonishes even me. And then I don&#039;t know what to call it. The various titles for this picture were suggested by several people. Only Garten im Regentropfen is by me. Theatre, Cabin and Mouth came from other people. (from: Hundertwasser, Buchheim Verlag, Feldafing, 1964, p. 28)  On the way to Anguillara Sabazia on Lake Bracciano, where I was invited to visit Alberigo Bruni, a friend and the proprietor of Galleria Medusa in Rome.

paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(460,'I like the house very much and the spiral very much. This is the first time I combined both so closely. I was astonished myself how well spiral and house suit each other. I called the picture &quot;The Neighbours&quot;. Since the spiral is a symbol of the sun to me and the house a symbol of the moon, I put gold in the middle of the spiral and painted a silver window in the middle of the house. Here I painted a spiral in complementary colours for the first time. That is: beginning in the middle I painted a contrast of red and green. As the red spiral devolves outward, it slowly turns violet and blue and green, and for this line I always chose the proper complementary colour. I often sign the pictures at their various corners, to indicate clearly that they can be hung in different ways. This always makes for complications and arguments when hanging the pictures for exhibitions when I&#039;m not on hand, because nobody knows how the picture is supposed to be hung, because it is signed on various sides. I don&#039;t paint pictures the way others do, on an easel; I paint them lying horizontally on a table and often by rotating them around their own midpoint. In Japan, for instance, where it is so complicated to stand up and sit down, I had a system for painting large pictures: I put a book on the table on which the picture could be spun like a disk. As far as the arm could reach toward the middle of the picture I could have a command of the picture and paint. I could not really see the picture until it was finished - when I had a chance to stand up and set it up vertically. That is why my pictures viewed from above often go from top to bottom or bottom to top - like the constellations (from: Hundertwasser, Buchheim Verlag, Feldafing, 1964, p. 24)').
paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(464,'I painted this picture this way on purpose - as self-therapy - just as Salvador Dal&Atilde;&shy;, for one, said that to free oneself of certain illnesses or complexes, one should paint them. That is often used in therapy, I believe. If somebody is afraid of dying he must paint death. Or if someone is frail he should paint frail people. Well, it always annoyed me - I have a house in the countryside of Normandy, and it is very beautiful and everything is very green and the trees grow marvellously - I&#039;m always annoyed because the Route nationale, the French motorway, is too close to the house. I admit it is three hundred or five hundred meters away, but it annoyed me anyway. So I decided to paint a picture in which this Route nationale - painted red here, i. e., especially toxic - is neutralised. And then I painted my house down here and forced myself to think of the Route nationale as something beautiful even if so many loud things are on the move on it. And in the course of the painting I painted in the steamer moving right through the meadow, and this cured me of this affliction, and now I am glad the Route nationale is near the house. A steamer with the smoke rising stright up is a symbol for me, too. I painted a series of steamers with smoke coming out of their smokestacks, steamers that sing, and because in a choir many voices produce an image, the smoke from many steamers results in a song. (from: Hundertwasser, Buchheim Verlag, Feldafing, 1964, p. 22) Every time I came back I heard chain saws. The word had been passed around in the neighbourhood, &quot;Monsieur Stowasser is back&quot;.

It was like a dream, a dream which I had been painting for years. Floating houses have round windows.

Of course Vasarely has done a lot in this way, but it isn&#039;t organic. Later, colour combinations of the same pictures cast their spell on me in print graphics, e.g., the 10,002 variations of 860 Homo Humus come va.

paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(472,'This painting means quite a lot to me - I am always glad when I can invent something new. It was in Sottomarina, and I was crossing a bridge, and suddenly I saw people wearing sunglasses coming towards me on bicycles, and I suddenly discovered the glasses, as if I had never seen spectacles before. For me that was the very discovery of eyeglasses. From that day on I have looked on glasses only as spirals and as something uncannily magical, as magic instruments, as it were, that one can look through, through which one sees the world differently - indeed, I think one could write books about eyeglasses. Of course glasses are also a mask which covers the eyes. For me glasses are almost worth more than the eyes themselves, that is, glasses are a counterpart to the eyes, equivalent to the eyes. And add to this the &quot;nose-river&quot;. I always depicted noses as rivers. And something is in fact always flowing down in the nose, and since a river is blue, I always paint noses blue. Beneath it the mouth is a boat: the mouth-boat. To me mouths are like boats - by virtue of their shape. So there are three symbols in the picture: the spiral glasses, the nose-river and the mouth-boat. And then there is the symbol of the garden fence . . . What that means I don&#039;t know myself. It is also interesting that the face has been squeezed into a square. Basically I don&#039;t want to depict any human figure and human faces anymore, and this is one anyway.

There in his nose is the flower, whose noxious scent slowly spreads out in beautiful waves across his face. A face which in death is turning pale and pink and cold and bloated and flat and broad. The flower has already eaten through the nose and is turning the facial flesh outward. The blue gas is falling like snow on the eyelids. The eyes are narrowing and getting red rings of death. The nostrils, where the scent entered, are turning into the gates to the beyond. They are silver, gold and black, just as the funeral colours in Europe have unfortunately become. The pupils, too, have become small gold dots and the mouth a small silver slit, and the nose-flower has silver petals.

The perfume makers were furious; never had personalities for whom perfumes had been named, and more renowned ones than I, ever made demands about the scent. So the Hundertwasser perfume bottle came to naught.').

I was living for two months with a French family I was friends with in a castle on Corsica and put together picture grounds, primed and painted within the cool, thick walls, while streams of tourists passed by in the searing heat outside. I had this feeling of comfort when painting in the barrel vaults on Santorin, too, in the cool mountains of Tahiti, in the dwelling caves of Matmata in Tunisia, where I had to put on a sweater even though the hot desert was up above, and in my mill on the Kamp, where it was warm at my wood-burning stove while there were often sub-zero temperatures outside.').

I told the Emir&#039;s son how beneficial a grass roof could be in the desert, if, for instance, one could water gardens on one&#039;s own roof with grey water (used water and bathwater). Then it would be cool and no air-conditioning would be needed. Besides, the shady park overhead can be laid out with beautiful stones.

paint_hundertwasser_comment_ge(673,'There are numerous watercolours I painted on paper with irregular edges. Since I started painting on solid grounds such as wood, wood-particle or plywood panels, I continued with this tradition of mine, with pieces of wood I found on the street in Paris. Now that I can afford to acquire the best and most expensive grounds at the most exclusive paint-supply shops, it is completely unsatisfactory to me, it even kills all creativity. So I often walk through the streets of Paris before dawn, before the garbage trucks come, and find the most fantastic painting grounds, sometimes sticking out of poubelles, sometimes lying right on the street. Jigsaw wood, plywood panels missing a corner or with frayed edges, discarded restaurant signs, switchboards such as this one, with the switches still on them, and much more. Paris at daybreak is a treasure chest. Finding all these things on the street, in the cold morning fog, when Paris is just waking up, puts me in an unspeakably enthusiastic mood. While taking it all home, I am already thinking about which pieces I will put together with which others, which often results in still more irregularity, of edges and thickness, and what I will paint on them. Back home they are cleaned, glued, nailed, primed, and the resulting panels are already works of art, in back as well as in front, almost too beautiful to be painted on. In this way the true preciousness of the painting ground comes about, on which one is simply duty-bound to paint something precious and beautiful.

In addition, Gilles Arthur invited people to a salad which I prepared in a wooden bowl with a wooden fork and spoon Paul Gauguin had carved himself. If these objects are used, they keep; if put in a glass case, they quickly deteriorate in the tropics.

In the winter I set up a large mirror in such a way that it reflected more daylight on the ceiling. Now and then I had a visitor.

I was proud I could find my way home in the dark without a flashlight. The eyes get used to the darkness. Many pictures were painted. I placed them all together for a photograph.

It fascinated me that life in New Zealand is like in Europe and not the other way round, that cars move around just like here, that the air is the same, too. When I was very young I had read a book by Andreas Reischek, an Austrian explorer who had travelled through New Zealand in the last century, and here I came to realise that he had looted Maori treasures and exterminated rare bird species.

The thirty sheets were then copied on primed paper and mounted on canvas in the proper sequence and painted with mixed techniques, i. e., watercolour, acrylic paint, tempera, oil, lacquer and metal. This picture turned into one of my biggest adventures as a painter. As to the thematic material, which came about of itself, as it were, it is decidedly of a fairy-tale nature, as if from a children&#039;s book - a collection of Hundertwasser motifs.

The painting was then dismantled together with its brick wall, sawed up into 13 irregular pieces by Riccardo Licata and stored in Basel. In freight containers it was shipped to Long Island, where it was joined together again by Licata in the reformed Synagogue, an old Romanesque castle. In 2007 the painting was dismantled again together with its brick wall, but in one piece and removed from the synagogue. Since then it is in private possession.').
